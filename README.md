# ABS-using-Eddy-current-based-electromagnetic-brakes
In this project I have made an ABS matlab simulink model for an electric vehicle
It consists of an AC-DC converter, PMSM motor, Electromagnetic brakes etc.
The ABS_simulink_model was downloaded from the following repository: https://github.com/stephenkingston/ABS_demo_simulink
